The aim of this app was to simulate the functioning of a basic Fitness App.
# About the App
Its primary purpose is to provide the users with approximate details of their body health in terms of maximum heart rate, their Body Mass Index (BMI) by taking basic information of the user such as age, height, and weight.
This calculation then provides a user-specific diet chart that the user can incorporate into his/her daily intake. (It is advisable to consult a dietician to verify the results of the app)
Lastly, it gives a fair amount of idea regarding the number of calories burnt by the user while performing a certain kind of exercise.
